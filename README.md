This repository contains simulation files and data used in the [study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.27.672390v1) - **Biomolecular phase boundaries are described by a solubility product that accounts for variable stoichiometry and soluble oligomers**

We used the [SpringSaLaD software](https://vcell.org/ssalad) platform to run Langevin dynamics simulations. _SIM.txt files exemplify input files generated by the software. SpringSaLaD has a convenient GUI to visualize the model components. One can also use these [notebooks](https://github.com/SpringSaLaDpy/SpringSaLaDpy_demo/blob/main/Examples/analysis(Nephrin-Nck-NWasp).ipynb) to inspect the model in greater details. 

A8_B8_count_15_15_SIM.txt refers to input file containing 15 molecules of octavalent A and B. Similarly, other files represent A9_B7, A10_B6, A12_B4 respectively.

Inter-sticker binding affinity = 350 ÂµM, as measured in [Li et al. 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3343696/) 

The folder "Simulation data" contains results for 4 systems. For each system, 64 concentration points are analyzed.
